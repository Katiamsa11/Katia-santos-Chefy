## About Chefy

Chefy is a web-based platform to connect chefs with households for private in-home dining experiences. Clients can search for and book the chef best suited for their event.

Chefy is my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp. Where we had to come up with a full-stack application in two weeks. I want to keep developing this project to create a chef side and many more feautures to complete this application.

Thank you for checking out my project!
